### Ragu's Individual Capstone Assessment
Most of professional experience I have so far has something to with web. Ever companies are using website and web page to 
interact with their customers. My team has decided on creating a web application for our senior design project. We will be 
re-creating retro console game call voltorbflip. My understanding is this project might be little tough on team as we will be 
learning a lot of JavaScript as we build. Our academic courses donâ€™t really prepare us to build these types of apps, but we 
all have some exposure in this filed therefore we decided to take on this challenge.
    There has been lot of development with various team during different programming and other technical courses I have taken toward 
my degree. There are courses like Python and C++ courses that taught great amount of basics of programming which will help me on 
this project to learn new programming languages I need to learn while working on this project. Software engineering course taught 
good amount of how software teamwork and some of the tools to successfully build software as a team. Since everyone in my team 
has taken this course, we all can contribute some concept we learned in that course. Some of my IT minor classes like SQL and 
.NET Core Web App course should help me understand basics of create web app. Since there was more conceptual course on our 
program than directly teaching us how to build app, this is an interesting challenge to apply those concepts to build robust app.
    My first co-op was at Emerson Electric. I was part of software development team as software development intern. During my 4 
month there, I have team of developer create a web application to help business need. I learned a lot about create web app 
with .NET, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. This is experience will be handy during this project since I will need to know most of 
the technology I learned. My second co-op is at Medpace Inc. Here I am learning about creating web app with newer technology like 
Angular and that should come to help on this project as well.
    I am really excited to work on this project because I have never worked on creating a web game with HTML, CSS and JS. I have 
had web app experience, but it is most communicating with customers but not web game experience. I have always wanted to learn
JS but have never found motivation to learn. This is excellent opportunity to learn JavaScript as well.  We were discussing some
approach for the solution. While that is still in planning phase out goal is to make our site more exciting for visitors. Game is
fun but we want the navigating around our site even more exciting.
    The expected outcome of the project is of course to create very interactive, engaging web page. I expect to contribute a lot
to this project from coding side and as well documenting our project. Our project must be interactive and must be well looking 
from UI perspective for use to mark the project as done. I will be very satisfied with my self-elevation if I can contribute good 
amount of time toward achieving project goal. Non-technical wise I want to help my team with documentation and any deliverables 
that are due throughout the project. At the end, team will be evaluated based on how much each member were able to contribute and what
to final product looks like.
