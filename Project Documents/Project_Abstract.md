Our vision for what our product should look like is a web page with a score on it and the game underneath. The game will have five pots at the bottom of the column and 5 rows of leaves making a 5x5 grid. The objective of the game will be to flip over the leaves and avoid flipping over a leaf that had a exploding(red) tangerine behind it. There will be clues on each of the pots and end of the rows that tell you the point value of the row and how many exploding tangerines are on each row. When flipping over a leaf (one square of the 5x5 grid) you will either get a red, green, orange, or gold tangerine. Red tangerines end the game. Green tangerines are worth 1, orange tangerines are worth 2 and gold tangerines will be worth 3. The points will be multiplicative, as in every time you get a tangerine, it gets multiplied to your current score.
