I want to use these technical skills I have learned thorughout my academic career and as co-op in those places to create a great senior project.
I am looking for something like web appliction that uses .NET MVC design pattern or uses C#/.NET API calls for back-end jobs. I am open to other
project espically that uses C#/.NET. It's alright if it doesn't use technology stack I am familar with but it could take me sometime to learn and 
can become diffcult to contribute same amount as someone who is really good at it.
